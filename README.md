# Simple Text Document Processor

This program was an assignment of the [Object Oriented Design and Analysis](http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/skotthe/classes/cs5004/Spring/2017/syllabus.html) Course

## [Problem Description](http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/skotthe/classes/cs5004/Spring/2017/module7.html#btab-2)

## Running the program

I included some sample md files in the [io folder](https://github.com/jeremylinlin/simple-text-doc-processor/tree/master/src/test/java/edu/neu/ccs/cs5004/assignment10/problem1/io). Add the file path as the argument and run the program (Main class), the output file will be generated in the same folder with an extra .out extension.

**Note that those original md files will be RENDERED IN MARKDOWN FORMAT when viewed on GitHub, which is FAR FROM THE SAME with the raw file as well as the output of the program.**
